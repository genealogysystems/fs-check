The marriage place of `{{place}}` has not been standardized for the marriage between
[{{wifeName}} and {{husbandName}}](https://familysearch.org/tree/#view=coupleRelationship&relationshipId={{crid}}). 

Standardization ensures that everyone knows where this event took place.
Because there are many different ways to spell or qualify a place, it may not always be obvious where that place actually is.
Take `London` for example. Is this the London in England, Kentucky, or Ontario?
By standardizing the place we can avoid this confusion.
