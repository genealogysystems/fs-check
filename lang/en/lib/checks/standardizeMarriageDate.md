The marriage date of `{{date}}` has not been standardized for the marriage between
[{{wifeName}} and {{husbandName}}](https://familysearch.org/tree/#view=coupleRelationship&relationshipId={{crid}}).

Standardization ensures that everyone knows when this event took place.
Because there are many date formats used accross the world, it may not always be obvious what the date actually is.
Take `3/11/2000` for example. Is this March 11, 2000 or November 3, 2000?
By standardizing the date we can avoid this confusion.
